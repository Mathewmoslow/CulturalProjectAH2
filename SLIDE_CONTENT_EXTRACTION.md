## SLIDE 6: Root Causes & Risk Factors

**SLIDE NUMBER:** 6 / 21

### Title
Root Causes & Risk Factors

### Content Blocks

**Historical Context**
- **Subheading:** Centuries of Cultural Disruption
- **Content:** The diabetes epidemic in Native American communities did not happen by chance—it is the result of centuries of forced cultural disruption. Historical trauma from colonization, forced relocation to reservations, and the boarding school era created intergenerational mistrust of healthcare systems
- **Citations:** (Walls & Whitbeck, 2012; Gone & Trimble, 2012)

**Dietary Transition**
- **Subheading:** From Traditional Foods to Commodity Rations
- **Content:** Perhaps most significantly, there was a forced dietary transition from traditional, healthy foods to government commodity foods high in sugar, refined flour, and lard. This shift from lean proteins, vegetables and whole grains to processed foods like frybread directly fueled the diabetes epidemic.
- **Citation:** (Wedekind et al., 2021)

**Cultural Attribution**
- **Subheading:** "White Man's Sickness"
- **Content:** Some Native patients describe diabetes as a white man's sickness—a disease brought by cultural disruption. Understanding these root causes is essential for providing effective, compassionate care.
- **Citation:** (Jernigan et al., 2020)

**Major Complications:**
- 36% have cardiovascular disease (IHS, 2024)
- 31% with chronic kidney disease; ESRD incidence 1.6× higher than non-Hispanic whites (IHS, 2024; Wedekind et al., 2021)
- 24% with diabetic retinopathy among those examined (IHS, 2024)
- 4% have documented lower extremity amputation (IHS, 2024)
- Cultural stoicism and fatalistic attitudes toward diabetes may lead to late presentation and delayed treatment, exacerbating complications (Wedekind et al., 2021)

## SLIDE 10: Health Beliefs & Medicine Wheel Approach

**SLIDE NUMBER:** 10 / 21

### Title
Health Beliefs & Medicine Wheel Approach

### Content Blocks

**Holistic Worldview Section**
- **Subheading:** Four Dimensions of Health
- **Main Content:** The Medicine Wheel represents the holistic worldview central to Native American health beliefs. It has four quadrants—Physical, Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual—all must be in balance for true health. Diabetes is a manifestation of imbalance across all four dimensions.
- **Citation:** (Jernigan et al., 2020)

**Four Dimensions of Health (Medicine Wheel):**

1. **Physical**
   - Blood sugar management, medication adherence, exercise

2. **Mental**
   - Diabetes education, understanding disease process

3. **Emotional**
   - Family support, coping with chronic illness

4. **Spiritual**
   - Traditional ceremonies, connection to culture

**Nursing Note:**
Nurses must explore these beliefs respectfully and align diabetes care plans with patients' cultural worldview, using concepts of balance and harmony when discussing treatment goals.

**Visual Note:** Figure 4 - Medicine Wheel - Four dimensions of health

### Cultural Beliefs

**Important Perspectives:**
- **Cultural Stoicism:** Men under-report symptoms, viewing illness as weakness (Wedekind et al., 2021)
- **Fatalistic Attitudes:** Some view diabetes as inevitable (Wedekind et al., 2021)
- **Harmony Disruption:** Illness signals imbalance across all dimensions (Jernigan et al., 2020)

**Key Stat:** 4 Dimensions of health that must be balanced for healing

## SLIDE 12: Family Dynamics & Decision-Making

**SLIDE NUMBER:** 12 / 21

### Title
Family Dynamics & Decision-Making

### Content Blocks

**Collectivist Culture Section**
- **Subheading:** The Central Role of Family
- **Content:** For Native American patients with diabetes, family is central to all healthcare decisions. Family extends beyond the nuclear unit to include extended relatives, elders, and community members. Decision-making is a collective, consultative process—not individual.
- **Citation:** (Jernigan et al., 2020)

**Elder Authority Section**
- **Subheading:** Respecting Traditional Hierarchy

**Key Points:**
- Elders' opinions carry tremendous weight and may approve major treatment decisions (Jernigan et al., 2020)
- Multiple relatives may attend appointments—welcome this, not view as crowding
- In some tribes, matriarchal figures lead health decisions and must be included in care
- Collectivist culture means family/tribe needs take precedence over individual preferences—this is a strength to leverage (Jernigan et al., 2020)

**Visual Note:** Figure 5 - Multigenerational family structure. Photo: Adobe Stock

### Nursing Strategies

**Family-Centered Diabetes Care:**
- View the family as essential allies in diabetes care, not obstacles
- Frame benefits in family terms: "This insulin helps you stay strong to care for your grandchildren"
- Involve entire family in diabetes education sessions
- Facilitate family consultations when needed for major treatment decisions
- Remember: Extended family structure includes relatives, elders, and community

## SLIDE 14: Gender Issues & Middle-Aged Males

**SLIDE NUMBER:** 14 / 21

### Title
Gender Issues & Middle-Aged Males

### Content Blocks

**Developmental Stage Section**
- **Subheading:** Generativity vs. Stagnation (Ages 40-65)
- **Content:** Middle-aged Native American men face unique cultural and gender-based challenges with diabetes. This age group corresponds to Erikson's (1982) Generativity versus Stagnation stage, where men focus on contributing to family and community. Diabetes threatens this generative role, requiring sensitive reframing.
- **Citation:** Erikson, E. H. (1982). The life cycle completed: A review. W. W. Norton & Company.

**Cultural Stoicism Section**
- **Subheading:** Barriers to Care-Seeking

**Key Barriers:**
- Cultural conditioning promotes stoicism—expressing pain/illness seen as weakness (Wedekind et al., 2021)
- Men under-report diabetes symptoms like neuropathy pain or vision changes
- Healthcare-seeking viewed as weakness, causing reluctance to attend appointments
- Provider/protector role identity threatened by chronic illness (Erikson, 1982)

**Reframing Strategy:**
Reframe diabetes self-care as fulfilling the provider role: "Taking insulin helps you stay strong for your family. Blood sugar monitoring shows responsibility as a father."

**Visual Note:** Figure 6 - Middle-aged man in generative stage. Photo: Adobe Stock

**Key Stat:** 40-65 - Age range - Generativity vs. Stagnation (Erikson)

### Nursing Approach

**Strengths-Based Messaging:**
- Frame diabetes management as strength, not weakness
- Emphasize family responsibility and community contribution
- Enable continued generative work of guiding next generation
- Acknowledge historical trauma's impact on healthcare trust

## SLIDE 16: Spirituality & Religion in Healing

**SLIDE NUMBER:** 16 / 21

### Title
Spirituality & Religion in Healing

### Content Blocks

**Inseparable from Healing Section**
- **Subheading:** Spirituality as Central to Care
- **Content:** Spirituality is inseparable from diabetes healing in Native American culture. Many practice both traditional Native spirituality and Christianity—syncretism is common, and both traditions provide spiritual support for diabetes management.
- **Citation:** (Jernigan et al., 2020)

**Spiritual Practices Section**
- **Subheading:** Ceremonies & Sacred Items

**Practices Include:**
- Bedside rituals, prayer circles, healing songs, drumming for diabetic patients
- Sun Dance and Night Chant offer spiritual strength for chronic illness
- Medicine bags, eagle feathers, sacred herbs never removed without permission
- Many view diabetes as spiritual test sent by Creator (Jernigan et al., 2020)

**Integration Note:**
Spiritual ceremonies and connection to land/ancestors provide mental health support essential for diabetes management (Jernigan et al., 2020). Spirituality is central to holistic healing.

**Visual Note:** Figure 7 - Spiritual practices in healing. Photo: Adobe Stock

**Historical Trauma Section**
- **Subheading:** Boarding Schools & Mistrust
- **Content:** Historical trauma from boarding schools and forced assimilation created profound mistrust of healthcare systems
- **Citations:** (Gone & Trimble, 2012; Walls & Whitbeck, 2012)
- Nurses must acknowledge this trauma explicitly and address through transparent, respectful care

### Nursing Protocols

**Respect & Accommodation:**
- Respect sacred items at all times—never remove without permission
- Accommodate spiritual practices when possible with hospital permissions
- Recognize that spiritual healing aids physical diabetes outcomes
- Focus on positive healing rather than direct death talk (culturally taboo)

## SLIDE 18: Diet, Nutrition & Food Access

**SLIDE NUMBER:** 18 / 21

### Title
Diet, Nutrition & Food Access

### Content Blocks

**Traditional vs. Modern Diet Section**
- **Subheading:** From Ancestral Foods to Commodity Rations
- **Content:** Traditional Native diets were diabetes-protective: lean proteins from wild game/fish, the Three Sisters (corn, beans, squash), berries, nuts, seasonal vegetables. These unprocessed foods provided balanced nutrition and natural blood sugar regulation.
- **Citation:** (Wedekind et al., 2021)

**Commodity Foods Impact Section**
- **Subheading:** Frybread & the Diabetes Epidemic
- **Content:** Forced relocation created dependency on government commodity foods high in refined flour, sugar, and lard. Frybread, now considered traditional, originated from these rations and fuels the diabetes epidemic.
- **Citation:** (Wedekind et al., 2021)

**Food Desert Reality Section**

**Critical Statistics:**
- 76.7% on reservations live >1 mile from grocery vs 41.2% general U.S. (USDA, 2021; Wedekind et al., 2021)
- Nearly 50% have income ≤200% poverty level vs 28.9% general U.S. (Wedekind et al., 2021)
- High rates of lactose intolerance affect dairy nutrition recommendations

**Visual Note:** Figure 8 - My Native Plate - Culturally adapted diabetes nutrition. Source: SDPI (2022)

**Key Stat:** 76.7% On reservations live in food deserts (>1 mile from grocery)

### Nursing Strategies

**Culturally Responsive Nutrition Care:**
- Frame dietary changes as returning to ancestral foods (SDPI, 2022)
- Involve entire family in meal planning for diabetes
- Suggest healthier preparation methods (baking vs frying)
- Acknowledge food access challenges honestly (USDA, 2021)
- Connect patients with SDPI and nutrition assistance (SDPI, 2022)

**Key Insight:**
Returning to traditional foods is a powerful diabetes intervention that honors heritage while improving control (SDPI, 2022)

## SLIDE 20: Communication & Special Considerations

**SLIDE NUMBER:** 20 / 21

### Title
Communication & Special Considerations

### Content Blocks

**Cultural Communication Styles Section**
- **Subheading:** Understanding Differences

**Communication Nuances:**
- **Limited Eye Contact:** Shows respect, not disengagement (Jernigan et al., 2020)
- **Silence:** Indicates thoughtful processing, not lack of understanding (Jernigan et al., 2020)
- **"Yes" Means:** "I hear you" rather than agreement—verify understanding
- **Storytelling:** Preferred method—use diabetes success stories from community
- **Humor:** Important coping mechanism, should be welcomed

**Building Trust Section**
- **Subheading:** Overcoming Historical Trauma
- **Content:** Boarding schools and unethical medical experiments created profound mistrust of healthcare systems
- **Citations:** (Gone & Trimble, 2012; Walls & Whitbeck, 2012)
- Nurses must acknowledge this trauma explicitly and build trust through transparency

**Cultural Concept:**
Indian Time reflects flexible, present-focused time orientation (Jernigan et al., 2020). Be adaptable with scheduling rather than labeling patients as noncompliant.

**Visual Note:** Figure 9 - Culturally responsive communication. Photo: Adobe Stock

### Access Barriers

**Geographic & Financial Challenges:**
- Limited transportation to diabetes appointments (Wedekind et al., 2021)
- Long distances to IHS clinics (IHS, 2024)
- Financial constraints for insulin and testing supplies

### Solutions

**Practical Interventions:**
- Telehealth for glucose monitoring and diabetes education
- Coordinate with local IHS facilities for continuity (IHS, 2024)
- Involve Community Health Representatives as cultural liaisons
- Connect with SDPI resources (SDPI, 2022)
- Support talking circles for peer diabetes support (Jernigan et al., 2020)
